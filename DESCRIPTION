Description: SQLDataFrame is developed to lazily represent and
    efficiently analyze SQL-based tables in _R_. SQLDataFrame supports
    common and familiar 'DataFrame' operations such as '[' subsetting,
    rbind, cbind, etc.. The internal implementation is based on the
    widely adopted dplyr grammar and SQL commands. In-memory datasets
    or plain text files (.txt, .csv, etc.) could also be easily
    converted into SQLDataFrames objects (which generates a new
    database on-disk).
